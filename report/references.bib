abstract="Generative adversarial networks have shown promise in generating images and videos. However, they suffer from the mode collapse issue which prevents it from generating complex multi-modal data. In this paper, We propose an approach to mitigate the mode collapse issue in generative adversarial networks (GANs). We propose to use multiple generators to capture various modes and each generator is encouraged to learn a different mode through a novel loss function. The generators are trained in a sequential way to effectively learn multiple modes. The effectiveness of the proposed approach is demonstrated through experiments on a synthetic data set, image data sets such as MNIST and fashion MNIST, and in multi-topic document modelling.",

Using Singularity containers, developers can work in reproducible environments of their choosing and design, and these complete environments can easily be copied and executed on other platforms. Singularity is an open source initiative that harnesses the expertise of system and software engineers and researchers alike, and integrates seamlessly into common workflows for both of these groups. As its primary use case, Singularity brings mobility of computing to both users and HPC centers, providing a secure means to capture and distribute software and compute environments. This ability to create and deploy reproducible environments across these centers, a previously unmet need, makes Singularity a game changing development for computational science.},
