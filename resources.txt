        TODO: Try Inception



> Find Data
    Go with suggested one
    OR
    with CIFAR 10 although it is not generated
    Decision: CelebA
    May try: CIFAR 10
    


> Try one of the algorithms on the data

    TODO: Make data bias on more than one attribute


> Try FID/InceptionScore on the data with one of the algorithms
    InceptionScore is for the distinc generated iamges. Try it with both default and your model


> Implement RankMe



> Try RankMe on the data with one of the algorithms




> Do the tests
